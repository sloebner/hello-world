hello-world
===========

I'm learning how to use GitHub and I'm already confused but it's ok. I'm smart. I'll figure it out.
So far it's making sense, but it's kind of creepy that it's all public and anyone can see this useless test repository I'm making. Too bad privacy costs the big bucks.
I like dogs.
I frequently downplay how much I like dogs because if people knew the extent of it I wouldn't have friends.
